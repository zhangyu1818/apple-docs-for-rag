## Discussion

The nib-loading infrastructure sends an `awakeFromNib` message to each object recreated from a nib archive, but only after all the objects in the archive have been loaded and initialized. When an object receives an `awakeFromNib` message, it is guaranteed to have all its outlet and action connections already established.

You must call the `super` implementation of `awakeFromNib` to give parent classes the opportunity to perform any additional initialization they require. Although the default implementation of this method does nothing, many UIKit classes provide non-empty implementations. You may call the `super` implementation at any point during your own `awakeFromNib` method.

Note

During Interface Builder’s test mode, this message is also sent to objects instantiated from loaded Interface Builder plug-ins. Because plug-ins link against the framework containing the object definition code, Interface Builder is able to call their `awakeFromNib` method when present. The same is not true for custom objects that you create for your Xcode projects. Interface Builder knows only about the defined outlets and actions of those objects; it does not have access to the actual code for them.

During the instantiation process, each object in the archive is unarchived and then initialized with the method befitting its type. Objects that conform to the NSCoding protocol (including all subclasses of UIView and UIViewController) are initialized using their `initWithCoder:` method. All objects that do not conform to the `NSCoding` protocol are initialized using their `init` method. After all objects have been instantiated and initialized, the nib-loading code reestablishes the outlet and action connections for all of those objects. It then calls the `awakeFromNib` method of the objects. For more detailed information about the steps followed during the nib-loading process, see Nib Files in Resource Programming Guide.

Important

Because the order in which objects are instantiated from an archive is not guaranteed, your initialization methods should not send messages to other objects in the hierarchy. Messages to other objects can be sent safely from within an `awakeFromNib` method.

Typically, you implement `awakeFromNib` for objects that require additional set up that cannot be done at design time. For example, you might use this method to customize the default configuration of any controls to match user preferences or the values in other controls. You might also use it to restore individual controls to some previous state of your application.
